## Original User Request:
An app to help someone learn a new language. The app should include AI-generated stories in the target language, where users can click vocab words or the entire story to see it in English. A different section includes flashcards, where the user is shown a word in the chosen language and can click it to flip the card and see the word in English. The final section includes an AI chatbot that allows the user to have simple conversations in the chosen language or ask questions in English about what a word means or how to form a sentence in the chosen language. All content should be beginner-friendly, focusing on basic greetings, common questions/answers, and vocabulary relevant to the lessons or stories. To start, the app should teach the user French, although we might add additional languages in the future.
